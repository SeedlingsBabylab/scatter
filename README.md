# scatter

A collection of scripts to distribute files back to their original home in Subject_Files.  

You will have to create text file with paths to the cha, opf and audio video basic level csvs manually. The files should be named:  
cha_paths.txt, opf_paths.txt, audiobl_paths.txt and videobl_paths.txt

These files should contain the paths at which the bl files should be moved (destination paths).

See example in path_files: a generic version of audiobl_paths.txt/videobl_paths.txt, generated by create_file_path.py, is in path_files and can be copied in the working directory (where the updated bl files currently are)

In a word, for audiobl:

- make the modifications you need in the working directory

- copy path_files/audiobl_paths.txt in your working directory (

- run python scatterbl.py path/to/working/directory/ --audio
