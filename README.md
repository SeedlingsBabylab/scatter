# Scatter

_To "scatter" the files back is to send them back from Working Files to Subject Files, renaming them as necessary. The scripts in this repo work together with the files in the path_files repo. Instructions to use the scattering scripts are as follows._

The files that need to be sent back are:
* Audio
    * .cha
    * wordmerged.csv (to be renamed to audio_sparse_code.csv)
    * audio coding issues
* Video
    * .opf
    * wordmerged.csv (to be renamed to video_sparse_code.csv)
    * video coding issues

Be sure to pull the most recent version of the repo before using
